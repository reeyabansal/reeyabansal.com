                <p><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python, sklearn, pandas, re, joblib, Logistic Regression</p>
                <p><strong>Motivation & Impact:</strong> This project was developed to identify fraudulent job postings, improving job seeker safety in online markets. 
                By implementing data preprocessing and feature engineering, I extracted relevant details from job descriptions and utilized scikit-learn to build a Logistic Regression model for detecting fraud. 
                The model was evaluated and refined through data visualizations, and team collaboration helped enhance its predictive capabilities. 
                <br> <br> This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning, data manipulation, and Python programming, while addressing a critical real-world challenge in the job market.</p>

                    <h3>Predicting Electricity Consumption using Weather Data (2024)</h3>
                    <!-- <img src="images/electricity-consumption.jpg" alt="Electricity Consumption" class="project-img"> -->
                    <p><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> R, Linear Regression, Statistical Analysis, ANOVA</p>
                    <p><strong>Motivation & Impact:</strong> This project aimed to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and household electricity consumption in Sceaux, France. 
                    I developed multiple linear regression models using R to process a large-scale dataset containing over 2 million measurements of power consumption and weather variables.
                    Through statistical analysis, I identified temperature, humidity, and daylight as key predictors of energy usage. 
                    I validated the models with ANOVA tests and residual analysis to ensure their reliability. 
                    The findings provide valuable insights for optimizing energy management, helping reduce costs in response to weather variations. 
                    <br> <br> This project showcases my proficiency in statistical analysis, data modeling, and R programming for practical applications in energy consumption prediction.</p>

                    <h3>News Software with Interactive World Map UI (2023)</h3>
                    <!-- <img src="images/news-software.jpg" alt="News Software" class="project-img"> -->
                    <p><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Java, Clean Architecture, NewsAPI Integration</p>
                    <p><strong>Motivation & Impact:</strong> This project focused on developing an interactive world map application for visualizing and filtering global news articles by region and language. 
                    I implemented clean architecture principles to ensure the application’s scalability, maintainability, and testability. 
                    By integrating NewsAPI, I was able to fetch real-time news data from multiple international sources and display it on a dynamic heat map visualization showing news activity intensity across different regions. 
                    The application allows users to filter news feeds based on time frame, language, and geographical location. 
                    Additionally, it provides intuitive features, including country-specific news views, article summaries, and trending news indicators. 
                    <br> <br> This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development, API integration, and creating user-centric applications to solve real-world information management challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Disease Diagnostic Software (2023)</h3>
                    <!-- <img src="images/disease-diagnostic.jpg" alt="Disease Diagnostic Software" class="project-img"> -->
                    <p><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python (tkinter), Graph Data Structures, Tree Algorithms</p>
                    <p><strong>Motivation & Impact:</strong> This project developed an interactive diagnostic tool to predict potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms using Python. 
                    I implemented a custom tree data structure, DiseaseTree, to model relationships between symptoms and diseases. 
                    The system also included a graph-based structure, PrecautionGraph, to analyze health data and generate personalized health precautions. 
                    With an intuitive tkinter-based user interface, users could input symptoms and visualize the disease likelihoods and recommended precautions. 
                    I designed algorithms to calculate disease probabilities based on symptom patterns and traverse complex symptom-disease relationships efficiently. 
                    <br> <br> This project demonstrates my strong algorithmic thinking, data structure implementation, and the practical application of computer science concepts to healthcare challenges.</p>
